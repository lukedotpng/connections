## Play the daily connections from your terminal! (WIP)

#### FYI
This project can be a bit buggy, especially with memory issues. Just did this for fun and to get some expirience again with C and ncurses! 

#### Build

-   Use `make` to build a binary into ./bin/connections
-   ncurses and libcurl are required to build this project
-   Works on MacOS and Linux, currently untested with Windows

#### How To Play

-   Use `WASD` or arrow keys to hover over different tiles
-   Press `space` to select a tile
-   Once you've selected four tiles, press `enter` to make a guess
